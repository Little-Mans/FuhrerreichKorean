FRA_FUHRERREICH_DESC:0 "'승리했지만, 그 대가는 무엇이였는가?' 대전쟁은 끝나고, 많은 프랑스인들이 이렇게 묻고 있습니다. 프랑스는 정당한 영토를 되찾았으며, 독일인들이 다신 조국을 위협하지 못하도록 라인란트에 보호령도 설립했습니다. 그렇지만, 1930년대가 끝나가며 유럽과 세계에서의 프랑스의 지위는 프랑스의 식민지를 위협하고 있는 적대적인 대영제국과 점차 호전적으로 변해가는 소련에 의해 위협받고 있습니다. 그렇지만 그 무엇보다도 중요한 문제는 대전쟁으로부터 회복한 독일이겠지요. 다가오는 폭풍으로부터 살아남으려면, 프랑스에겐 신중함, 용기, 그리고 휼륭한 외교를 필요로 할 것입니다.

The financial scandal, the Indochinese revolt, and rising German aggression have put far too much strain on the French government.

The party aims to universally increase rights and living standards not only for the male population, but the females and subjects of the Republic in the colonies.

The French defeat in the Franco-Prussian war left them bitter and spiteful towards the Germans, and this feeling would last another 40 years before they were allowed their revenge on the fields of the Great War. \n\nWith the end of the world’s most devastating conflict in 1919, the French were quick to enforce harsh demands upon the German nation. Full responsibility for damages caused by the war and a seemingly insurmountable series of debt payments destroyed the German economy and helped to bring France back to their hegemonic status in Europe. These economic burdens placed upon Germany, as well as the allied occupation of the Ruhr and Rhineland, forced Germany to default on their debts, and the nation went bankrupt. \n\nWhen German reperation payments stopped coming in, the French were forced to invade the Rhineland region and set up an Inter-Allied joint commission to administer the region. Along with this invasion of the Rhineland, the Saarland was occupied directly by the French army, in direct opposition from the Italians, British, and Americans, who had all participated in the occupation of the Rhineland. With the cecession of German reperation payments in 1933, exploitation of both the Rhineland and Saarland increased dramatically, leading to the Saarland being incorperated into the French Republic as the Sarre department. \n\nBy 1936, the ruling Bloc National continues to dominate French politics, seemingly unaware of the resurgant German power."

Several diffrent previaling schools of thought have taken hold, and the arguments nearly turned violent before the Chief of Army stepped in to mediate the situation. \n\nWhat followed were a series of live wargames in the Pas-de-Calais region of France, with one side representing Germany and the other representing France. What the officers found was that using conventional tactics, both armies were forced into a state of trench warfare within weeks of the simulated war beginning. A promising new "Guerre éclair" tactic showed many signs of success, involving a lightly armoured spearhead which would punch through the enemy lines before spreading out like a funnel, allowing allied soldiers to capture huge swaths of enemy troops and hostile land. Combined with an air offensive, it was believed that this new "Lightning War" could potentially turn the tide in France's favour during the next major continential war. \n\nIt was not soon after, however, that several officers found major faults with the plan. Fuel and supply shortages were rampant with this doctrine, and the risk of being cutoff from the main army was extremely high if the enemy force were able to break through the spearhead. It was for these reasons that the plan was essentially scrapped by the end of the wargames. \n\nWe may not have found our magical new doctrine, but the army has certainly learned a thing or two about fighting a modern, defensive war."

It would seem that as time goes on, the March becomes more and more socialist in nature, with many of the participants joining in the singing of "La Internationale" on a daily basis. \n\nThe leadership of our government has become quite frightened, and several divisions have been placed both in and around Paris as a preventitive measure in case the March does reach the city, but many citizens are doubtful that they will be able to stop this march if it continues for much longer."

It seems they are heading to Caen in order to further bolster their numbers, and their actions have put all of Paris on edge. There is a looming sense of dread hanging over the city, and many anxiously await the day when the dust cloud appears over the horizon and finally reaches the outskirts of the city.

Outposts lying in the rural areas outside of the city were quickly overrun by citizenry armed with both firearms and melee weapons, with a few posts even switching sides and joining the march. The East half of Paris is relatively untouched by the march due to the Seine River cutting the city in two, but the Arc de Triomphe has already been overrun and a red banner has been hoisted over the monument. The Palais Bourbon is within spitting distance of the now-rebel army, and many fear that a Second Paris Commune may soon become a reality, and the French military is finding it harder and harder to keep the rebels at bay without resorting to violence. There are confused screams flooding the streets, and few can tell friend from foe on ground level. \n\nShouting overtakes one of the alleyways as a barricade falls, and in a single moment of panic and confusion..."

A heavy silence has lingered over the city this past week, and many are waiting to see what the now murderous government will do in response to this tragedy. The fallen citizens of Paris have become Martyrs for both the extreme left and right, claiming that our government is no longer fit to rule the people nor the state over which it presides. There are talks of a second, organized Workers March in Marseille, and several high-ranking generals"

This party has little support outside of its already fringe movement, and they have found little support from either the SFIO or the PCF, and some believe the party itself may soon splinter and see its members scatter. Still, the PSOP has become a member of the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre, and have been appealing to disenfranchized and disillisioned members of both the SFIO and PCF, and the possibility remains that they may soon gain traction as a popular midddle-ground party for the socialist movement in France."

Our economists are doing their best to devise plans to combat this depression, but the French economy will be undoubtedly suffer for months to come, if not more. \n\nOur colonial offices, which are deeply tied to the Metropolitan economy, have seen a near-total collapse of their fledgling economies.

Intense fighting was reported on the island of Tenerife, and the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife held out despite being entirely surrounded for several hours.\n\nBy midday, the capital city had fallen and the marines had moved onto the final three Western islands in the chain. Small pockets of resistance held out in the forested mountains for over a day before finally being starved and coerced out into surrender. \n\nThe marines set up a local garrison upon the capture of the island chain, and were faced with only minor civilian resistance before finally handing the island chain over to the French government.

fra.64.d:0 "In a long-winded and needlessly verbose response, the Belgians have sent us a response in which they appear to have neither agreed to nor denied our demands, and they are clearly stalling for time. We cannot simply invade the Belgians, as we do not yet have a just cause, and we may risk an international coalition of nations reminiscent of that which brought down Napoleon I in the earth 19th Century.

This development has decisively turned the tables from our favour, and much of the government believes that a war with Britain could end disasterously with the current political situation in Europe. Backing down would make us look weak and lead to internal instability, but pressing our claim may drag us into a war in which we have no ability to win."

The man spoke a language unlike those at the airbase, and was soon identified to be of French origin. \n\nThe man explained that he was sent on a mission to circumnagivate the globe with his aircraft in as little time as possible, but he made a wrong course correction and landed here rather than Saigon where he intended to  be. Inspection of his aircraft showed that it was no longer airworthy and the engine was severely damaged from stress, but the airframe and the pilot are otherwise unharmed.\n\nThe pilot was taken to a nearby city and treated to the local food before being asked if he would like to be sent to Saigon where he could rejoin his comrades. Shockingly, the pilot declined the offer, and it seems he has taken a keen interest in our culture and country, and late in the day he asked if he could stay where he was, and join our Chinese Air Force. It seems that the pilot made his choice, and he was formally accepted into our air force as a pilot."

Letting this precious resource fall into their hands would be a tragic loss, and as such we have the option to set the fields alight and burn all of the oil. This will destroy the fields in the state, and will mean that the oil resource will be lost to us should we reclaim the state where the burning took place.

With the new autocratic governments ruling France and Italy, the "Swiss Question" has come up once more. Several promient members of the government are calling for the integration of Romandie into France, and even the PPF and PFNC support the idea. We will approach the Italians in order to decide the fate of Switzerland, and hopefully find a satisfying solution. \n\nThe Swiss government of course will not be invited to these talks, but why would they be?"

FRA_eng_menace_desc:0 "The aggressive British have shown their true face, and have pursued a staunchly anti-French foreign policy both in Europe and abroad. As English diplomats scramble to arrange alliances and treaties which aim to diminish our power, the Continential Entente watches dutifully along the coast for the royal ensign on the horizon.\n\n Of course, the best defense is a good offense, and the British will have a difficult time planning attacks against an enemy which is dynamically changing and evolving. As a result, we need to pursue our own anti-British policy and ensure that we don't see a repeat of the Hundred Years War."

FRA_penetrate_channel:0 "Penetrate the Channel"
FRA_penetrate_channel_desc:0 "The English channel has been under British hegemony for centuries past, and any naval excercises we attempt in the channel are often met with close supervision from the British.

###
FRA_demand_wallonia:0 "Demand Wallonia"
FRA_demand_wallonia_desc:0 "The overwhelming majority of the population living in the Belgian region of Wallonia speaks French, and a degree of them consider themselves ethnically French. A small political ideology exists within both Belgium and France known as Rattachism, which seeks to unite Wallonia with France and integrate it as a département. The rise of our militarist, nationalist, and expansionist government has finally allowed us to justify expressing our demands upon the Belgian government. \n\n§YThe Belgian government is unlikely to accept our demand, and if they have the backing of another major European power our chances of resolving this issue peacefully are practically zero. We should ensure our military is at full capability before sending our demands.§!"

FRA_infantry_equipment_production:0 "무장 표준화"
FRA_infantry_equipment_production_desc:0 "Conscripting more men into the Land Forces means more guns will be required in order to supply them all. The production of infantry equipment has been emphasized by our armament factories... But a problem is we simply could be doing a better job producing one Armament.

FRA_artillery_production_idea:0 "Common Components"
FRA_artillery_production_idea_desc:0 "Since the new doctrine doctrine of the Land Army is heavily dependent on the production of artillery, it is only natural that we increase our artillery production. However, we will need to undertake a more innovative approach to do this. We shall ensure the Artillery and Anti-tank weapons share common componets for maximum efficiency."

FRA_british_tariffs_desc:0 "Unrelenting British Economic protectionism continues to hurt us to this day. Harsh tariffs on French goods hurt our firms and inhibit our economic growth.

FRA_political_bickering:0 "Political Bickering"
FRA_political_bickering_desc:0 "Over the period of Laval's government, various groups of people in our nation have become discontent. Internally, Laval barely holds a majority whilst various conservative movements seem to be abstaining from the elections due to reorganisation or decline and hardline Communists aren't pleased with how SFIO is more moderate than they'd prefer. It is needless to say, some citizens don't feel they are properly being represented."

FRA_the_land_army_desc:0 "비록 대전쟁에서 승리하기는 했지만, 프랑스군은 지금 빈약한 상태입니다. 병사들의 무장은 잘 갖춰져 있으나, 18세에서 25세의 젊은이들이 대전쟁에서 모조리 전사해버리면서, 군에서 복무할 병사들의 수가 부족한 상태이지요. 만약 우리가 독일의 위협으로부터 유럽을 지키고자 한다면, 우리는 프랑스군을 재정비하고, 개혁해야만 합니다."
FRA_mechanized_warfare:0 "대규모 기계화"
FRA_mechanized_warfare_desc:0 "육군 장교 중 한 명인 샤를 드 골은, 최근 전차, 기계화 보병, 항공기, 그리고 다른 여러 종류의 장갑차량들의 운용을 육군 교리의 기반으로 삼아야만 한다고 말했습니다. 많은 수의 고위 장교들이 그의 의견에 반대하고 있기는 하지만, 어쩌면 이제 프랑스군도 '공격적인 전술'을 도입할 때가 됐을지도 모릅니다."
FRA_motorized_infantry:0 "차량화 보병"
FRA_motorized_infantry_desc:0 "일반 보병보다 빠른 속도로 움직일 수 있는 차량화 보병을 사용한다면, 우린 유리한 위치를 적보다 빠르게 선점할 수 있게 될 것이며, 승리를 간단히 거둘 수 있게 될 것입니다!"
FRA_airplane_technology:0 "비행기"
FRA_airplane_technology_desc:0 "비행기의 활용은 드 골의 계획에서 한 축을 담당합니다. 제공권을 확보하고, 적 지상군을 공격할 수 있는 비행기들은 빠르게 승리하는데 큰 도움이 될 것입니다."
FRA_tank_production:0 "전차 생산"
FRA_tank_production_desc:0 "드 골의 계획에서 가장 중요한 것은 새 전차들의 개발과 생산입니다. 이 전차들은 교착된 전선을 돌파하고 포위망을 형성함으로서 적군의 항복을 이끌어낼 수 있으며, 우리 군의 빠르고 간단한 승리를 보장해 줄 것입니다."
FRA_artillery_barrage:0 "대규모 화력"
FRA_artillery_barrage_desc:0 "대포의 포탄은 보병들의 총탄보다 훨씬 멀리 나갈 수 있습니다. 그러므로 우리가 만약 포병을 대규모로 운용한다면, 굳이 최일선 병사들을 적의 총탄에 노출시킬 필요도 없을 것입니다."

FRA_the_guard_on_the_rhine:0 "라인 강의 파수꾼"
FRA_the_guard_on_the_rhine_desc:0 "After the Great War, we saw to it that the German menace had been permanently weakened, so that they could never embroil Europe in yet another conflict.

fra.1.t:0 "The plane dispute"
fra.1.d:0 "Since we have begun to take an interest in reforming the Air Army, disputes on what type of plane to focus on have sprung up. A portion of the aerial high command supports investing in bomber planes while another part supports research fighter plane technology. Which one shall we choose?"
fra.2.d:0 "1870년에 있었던 보불전쟁 이후, 나폴레옹 3세의 프랑스 제2제국은 프랑스 제3공화국에게 그 자리를 넘겨주게 되었습니다. 보불전쟁에서 독일 제국에 처참한 패배를 당했던 프랑스인들은 독일에 똑같은 치욕을 안겨주기 위해 산업과 군대를 열심히 양성했었습니다. \n\nOn the 28th of July, 1914, exactly 43 years later, France had its opportunity when the Great War had broken out. Despite facing heavy resistance from its German foe, France was able to hold out long enough, through the use of trench warfare, when the German finally enacted the Schlieffen Plan which saw Germany invade neutral Belgium. Because of its obligation to Belgium through the Treaty of London of 1839, Britain was forced to enter the war on the side of the Entente. \n\nWhile France had had many close calls during the war, such as the Miracle of Marne which saw the British and French successfully defend Paris against the German onslaught, it eventually managed to fight off Germany until 1920, when an armistice was signed between the Entente and the Central Powers. \n\nFollowing the end of the Great War, France regained Alsace-Lorraine, which it had lost to the Germans following the Franco-Prussian War, a Rhenish puppet state was created to ensure that France could defeat the German menace at a moments notice, and the former German colonies of Cameroon and part of the German Gold Coast were given to France. \n\nDespite everything seemingly going well for France, old rivalries with Britain flared up, yet again, and saw the Entente split into two factions; the Continental Entente, lead by France, and the Imperial Protection Alliance, lead by Britain. France also faces numerous problems at home and abroad. Since the Great War was mostly fought in France, the French Republic now faces a demographic problem in which it has a shortage of 18-25 year olds. In addition, the army has grown stagnant, resisting reform. Furthermore, the German menace has been rising under the Valkist [GER.GetLeader], who has quickly consolidated power, promising to ‘right the wrongs’ of the Great War. France now faces many problems, both home and abroad. The question is, can she deal with them and persevere? Or is she doomed to fall yet again..."
fra.3.t:0 "Land Army doctrine dispute"
fra.3.d:0 "Due to the rather poor state of our army, it is clear that reformation is a top priority if we are to keep our army modern and intimidating enough to stave off the German menace. However, the Army High Command has been paralyzed because they are unable to come to a consensus on what doctrine our army should use. In order to settle the debate, once and for all, and bring back the glory of the Armée de terre, we choose the doctrine of..."
fra.4.d:0 "While much of the naval high command believes that battleships will continue to remain as the dominant capital ship, a portion of the high command is of the belief that carriers and naval aircraft in general will have a bigger role to play in the coming years of naval warfare. Either way, we have two choices in front of us. Do we support the orthodox tactics, or should we try something new?"
fra.5.d:0 "The new policy of conscription has been extremely unpopular with the French populace. Because of the losses sustained during the Great War, most, if not all, Frenchman are reluctant to go to war for the state. Opposition to this policy has been shown with various riots within some of the most populated areas of France. Infrastructure and factories have been destroyed by the rioters and stores have been looted. We must remedy the situation immediately, lest the French Republic falls into anarchy."
fra.6.d:0 "This time, the Communist Party of France have joined the rioters to protest conscription. More rioting has occurred in various regions, with looting and anarchy now commonplace in many places. This conflict is reaching a boiling point and may pose an actual threat to the French Republic."
fra.7.d:0 "Due to the amount of riots - both past and present - the French government has finally decided that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. We've two options in front of us: either we can negotiate with the leftists and try and reach a compromise or we can greatly reduce their power."
fra.8.d:0 "We've sat down with the head of the rioters, Maurice Thorez, who has told us that, unless the policy is repealed, the riots will not end. While we can, in theory, end the policy of conscription, it is crucial that we have men ready to serve in the Land Army. Alternatively, if we were to reduce conscription; it'd likely satisfy enough of the populace and then leave the Rioters without any support. What shall we do?"
fra.9.d:0 "It turns out our efforts at dispersing the Communists with force was in vain. Whilst we did manage to disperse them for a period of time; they ended up reorganising anyways. Once again, the Reds are screaming their lungs out in the streets of Paris and Caen protesting our efforts to silence them. They've garnered significant amounts of sympathy from onlookers and have increased the amount of Radicals in our beloved nation."
fra.10.d:0 "Since the reorganization of the Reds, they have been agitating throughout France and demanding an end of Conscription. There have been scuffles with the Police and Reds throughout various locations in our nation, a prominent area being Normandie. This situation has evolved into a powderkeg, however it seems that the only way to prevent this from getting worse is by taking all measures we can to ensure the Communists don't make the situation worse than it currently is... Lest the rioting gets even worse..."
fra.12.d:0 "Horrible news, today it seems the London stock exchange has plunged into a state of total meltdown. Following mass selling of stocks, it seems a majority of the world has been shaken worse than imaginable. Fortunately, given that the British have forced harsh tariffs on us during the interwar which shut us out of their economy; we haven't been as badly affected as some other nations. Regardless, we will persevere. We will defend the status quo in Europe, and we will not shy away from war because of some puny economic stagnation. Millions have died in the Great war, if we must make our Economic situation worse to prevent such another war from happening; so be it."

fra.34.d:0 "We desperately lack men. That much is obvious. There are nowhere near as many recruits signing up regularly for us to substantially expand our Military, which is absolutely crucial in the face of a hyper-aggressive Germany.\n\n However, we can combat this in various ways. Need be; we can direct recruits from colonial territories to serve in auxiliary roles in the Armee d'Terre. French Indochina is the perfect place for such an endeavour."
fra.35.d:0 "The French have been conducting Conscription in our territory! They're conducting conscription campaigns in our land and directing actual volunteers into the Armee d'Terre! Given their control of us there is little we can do to protest this audacious move..."
fra.36.d:0 "The Germans have broke through the Alsace-Rhine line! We must fully mobilize! We have severely underestimated the Germans, we must stop them here or fall! Everything we can muster will be used against the Germans, we've scrambled together a defensive plan to respond to this breakthrough and have pressed Great-War arms into service!"
fra.37.d:0 "Great news! It seems that the ongoing war has stimulated our economy! It seems to be stirring, perhaps this may be one of the few fruits of this war..."
fra.38.d:0 "It is often said that Friends who wish to remain Friends shouldn't talk about politics or religion. Whilst, the latter may not be particularly relavent at this moment; the former surely is. Philippe Petain and Francois Darlan, a set of good friends, have been discussing the status of the German menace during their personal visit to Petain's villa. Both men have come to the agreement that the government is responsible for the lack of action against Germany rather than France herself; and even the possibility of a coup was discussed if the government continues to appease to Germany."
fra.39.d:0 "Starting at approximately 2:34 AM, the Armee de Terre initiated its Coup. Within hours, the key locations throughout the nation were pacified, notably Paris, Brest and Marseille. Dentention of Politicians (mainly leftist) has been enacted, and various political posts have been abolished entirely in place of the new regime. With the Navy and Army firmly on our side, we've been able to properly control the situation without too much resistance.\n\nUnfortunately, the Airforce wasn't as firmly on our side. A sizeable portion of our air staff have attempted to remain loyal to the Republican Government, and we've been faced with little option but to eliminate them."
fra.40.d:0 "As the Junta strengthens its control over the country, we're going to need to make a series of decisions as to how we're going to solidify our hold over France. Of course, like any regime, the right to rule exists at a great price.\n\nFor now, we're faced with the question of dissidents within our society. First and foremost, it's likely for the best that we eliminate these dissidents in order to stamp out any further resistance. However, that might further estrange the population; not to say that they haven't been estranged yet, however it'd certainly make matters more uncomfortable for them."
fra.41.d:0 "Recently, an inevitable question has cropped up following the establishment of our new regime. Precisely the matters of our economy and its structuring. At the moment, we've retained semi-privatized markets which were favoured by the Third Republic. Of course, we can outright nationalize industries and put them under state-control, or we can work with the current system by completely privatizing the markets, a form of Market Autocracy."
fra.42.d:0 "Concerning our populace, it's likely a good idea that we decide on how to handle the youth. Of course, the Armee de Terre always needs more recruits, and thus combat training is a rather enticing option, however political indoctrination can ensure that the youth remains firmly loyal to our cause."
fra.43.d:0 "The French Radical-Left has been a problem since times immemorial, today we are to decide on how we should punish them. Now, without a doubt, being a socialist is a crime within our society, as socialists seek to undermine the principles and ethics that France is structured around. They're a direct threat to the Fatherland. Whilst detaining these socialists isn't much of a concern, how we punish them is. We can get rid of them by deporting them to the Colonies, or simply imprison them in recorrectional facilities. Alternatively, we can instead make them serve their sentence in the Armee de Terre, which could bolster the ranks of our Army at the cost of allowing these socialists to avoid imprisonment."
fra.44.d:0 "It's been 2 months since the Junta ended the Republic which became a detriment to the survival of France. No longer shall France find herself blocked off from Glory by Democracy, no longer shall France be ignored and dismissed, no longer shall France find herself unwilling and unable to act; the New Regime will accomplish what the old could not. As our position in power has been firmly secured, we can safetly look outwards and bring honour to the name of France."
fra.45.d:0 "The parliament has been hindering progress since it's inceptoin, it's only logical to abolish it entirely but this could result in opposition from our population. So there has been proposed as a compromise to reduce the parliament to an advisary status which would make the backlash from the population less severe."
fra.46.d:0 "Large amounts of the judiciary is in support of the weak republic, this can't be accepted of course, but if we would replace the entire judiciary the population would likely see it as a powergrab instead of saving France like we promised. So we can instead just replace the high court which would make it look more like an action to save France."
# - East Africa Revolt Stuff

fra.50.d:0 "Reports from British Kenya have indicated that a revolt has begun spreading across the region, spurred on by poor working conditions and lack of political independence. British authorities have moved quickly to stamp out the rebellion from fear that it will spread across their African colonies. In their weakness however, we find ourselves with opportunity.\n\nGiven the poor state of relations between our two nations some within our Government have begun suggesting that we use this issue to take a stand against British rule in Africa, either through a formal condemnation or by directly sending supplies to the rebels in an effort to prolong the rebellion. The condemnation is likely to be ignored by Britain, but sending supplies to the rebels is likely only to anger the British deeply. It is our choice to make in the matter however."
fra.51.d:0 "The French Foreign Ministry made a statement this morning regarding our attempts to quell the on-going revolt in East Africa. Stating that our rule in the region has done nothing to assist in the development of the native peoples and that we have brought nothing but fear and destruction to Africa, the French Foreign Minister concluded with the demand that we change our attitudes towards our African colonies for the benefit of the natives, rather than for our own selfish needs.\n\nSuch a statement is mostly rhetoric, but with passions high in our Government over this statement there is a growing movement to demand the French retract their statement."
fra.52.d:0 "Reports from local commanders involved in restoring order to outlying regions in British East Africa have indicated a signficant surge in rebel activity following rumours of French equipment being shipped to assist in their revolt against our rule. Such an action has significantly hampered out ability to once more bring order to our territory, with High Command expecting it to take several more months than previously thought to fully crush the rebels.\n\nGovernment response has been predictable, largely angered by French meddling in our internal affairs the two favourite choices of our Ministers is either issue a demand to the French Government to cease supplying the rebels with arms, or bring proof of French involvement to the world stage in an attempt to garner diplomatic backing across the world."
fra.53.d:0 "In response to our condemnation of British rule in Arica, the British Government yesterday evening summoned our Ambassador to immediately explain our Government's move. Additionally, the British representative in Paris lodged a formal diplomatic protest over what they call 'French meddling in internal British affairs'."
fra.54.d:0 "This morning our Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and representative in London, was summoned by the Foreign Office where the the British proceeded to demand that we formally retract our condemnation of British rule in Africa. Naturally our Government is largely unphased by such a demand, and it is unlikely that the British will pursue the matter any further."
fra.55.d:0 "Yesterday evening the British Foreign Secretary held an urgent press conference with newspapers and media of the United Kingdom. Presenting so-called 'proof' of our involvement in sending supplies to British East Africa, the British Foreign Secretary demanded the immediate halt of French aid to the rebel forces, calling it a brazen act of interference in the affairs of another Great Power.\n\nDiplomatically this press conference has caused quite a stir around the world, though many within our Government believe that it will largely blow over in the coming weeks."
fra.56.d:0 "In response to our demands that their Government cease all funding and supply shipments to the rebels in East Africa, the French Government has so far refused to respond to any of our statements. Our Government does not believe that a response will be forthcoming - and that in order to save face and prevent a precedent being set for foreign involvement in our affairs - that our response must be harsh and immediate. As such, we are prepared to launch an immediate embargo on the French nation."
fra.57.d:0 "While some in our Government believed that British demands to cease funding and supplying rebels in their East Africa possessions was largely hot air, it would seem that the British were willing to follow through on their threats if we did not stop arms shipments immediately. As such the British Government has issued an embargo on our nations goods."

While relations with Hungary have been improving quite rapidly over the past months, this is still a very large decision for us to make. Allowing Hungary to join may permenantly sour relations with the other Balkan nations, and may lead to problems in the future. Alternativly, allowing Hungary to join will give us a strong foothold in the region, and will allow us to further increase our influence in the neighboring countries. This will also serve to curtail any Soviet or German expansionism in the area, and will allow us to attack from several directions if war ever breaks out."

The Rifle itself would be Automatic and utilize a rifle-sized calibre, and able to use exchangeable magazines in a similar fashion to what submachineguns are able to do. The rifle would act as a cross between a submachinegun and a Light Machinegun, being lighter and much more manoeuvrable. \n\n However, one problem is that the rifle is incredibly expensive to manufacture, and it looks as if it will take a large portion of time for MAS to correct those issues... It may be quite some time before we can even consider adopting it..."
frafla.2.d:0 "We've been planning the Paris Colonial Exposition since last year, mainly due to attacks on us by German and Soviet diplomats due to our colonial holdings. Surely, the answer to this problem would be to hold a festival of sorts which would paint our Colonial Empire in a beneficial light. However, we're faced with a question; what shall the Paris Colonial Exposition be centred around?"
frafla.3.d:0 "If we want the Paris Colonial Exposition to actually matter on a world-wide scale, we're going to need to allow other nations to participate in it; particularly ones with colonial holdings. Hopefully, by doing so, this will become more than diplomatic retaliation against German and Soviet claims, and hopefully will teach the world that there is a clear benefit to Colonialism."
frafla.4.d:0 "The French have provided us with an invite to the Paris Colonial Exposition. The point of this 'festival' of sorts seems to be a political move to change the face of their Colonial Empire, and they hope we also attend for the same purposes. Whilst we could of course attend, it would undoubtedly displease Germany and the Soviets, some nations who were very vocally against the notion of a Paris Colonial Exposition."
frafla.5.d:0 "Finally, after months of preparation; the Paris Colonial Exposition is finally open. Us alongside a handful of nations will finally be able to dismiss any anti-colonialist sentiments by showing them the clear benefits that can be reaped by Colonialism."
frafla.6.d:0 "It seems that the Paris Colonial Exposition has been massively popular, with millions visiting from across the Globe. However, the Hard-left has attempted to capitalize on this opportunity. They've set up their own demonstrations, attempting to portray the 'truth' of the Colonies. Overall, they've been very unsuccessful. Fewer than 10,000 people have actually gone to see these demonstrations out of the millions that have attended the P.C.E."

Unfortunately, this has culminated in an increase of support for the SFIO, and a small increase in support of the ideology of Syndicalism.\n\nNonetheless, they've garnered a large deal of support within recent time, and their promises to remedy the toil of the working class certainly hasn't been helping us. We might face more resistance in upcoming elections from the SFIO."
frafla.8.d:0 "The London Stock Market Crash has resulted in large amounts of frustration for Citizens across France, and a boom in support for the Right. It seems that Catholic support for the Action Française has drastically risen over recent weeks, further accelerated by Catholic support for Action Française condemnation of [Root.GetLeader]'s Government for failing to care for France's people without treading on their Faith. \n\nRegardless, they've gathered quite a deal of support from this development, and their promises to right the wrongs of [Root.GetLeader]'s Government hasn't been helping us.

Many Frenchmen found themselves further embittered by the British with the culmination of the London Stock Market Crash, and many Frenchmen blame the British for it. Whilst hating the British is not nessecarily abnormal in France, the abnormality comes from an increase in support for the Radical-Right, who also blame the British. \n\n'La perfide Albion' seems to have indirectly fueled a small growth of support for the Radical-Right in France."

frafor.73.d:0 "Britain has refused to allow us to sign the Dover Pact, it seems that our disputes have not yet been fully smoothed over."
frafor.74.d:0 "Before we attack the English scum, we must consider a plan filed by the Armee de l'Air and Marine Nationale. The attack plan details a bombing strike on Portsmouth by use of the Aeronautique Navale air wing in Cherbourg... After hours of continued bombing and air campaigns the English would see no option but to be forced out of Portsmouth or have their fleet sunk... But we would have the 2ème Région Navale waiting right outside. Once the survivors attempt to evacuate; they'd be right in the hands of the Marine Nationale. We might be able to seize some ships and put them to use, or simply sink them. /n/n However, this would be done before we declare war; thus we'd be able to catch the English off-guard. There is no doubt that if we were to undertake such a move we'd go down as undisputed Villians in history if we lose the ensuring War; but with an advantage like this... How could we lose?"
frafor.75.d:0 "French Naval Bombers seem to be approaching British Airzones, seemingly targeting the destination of Portsmouth; an area where one of our vital fleets are located. The French Government hasn't provided us with any warning beforehand, and one cannot dismiss that something about the situation is ominous in nature."
frafor.76.d:0 "Whilst our fighters were able to catch up to the air squadron eventually, it became apparent that the French Armee de l'Air was carrying out attacks against the Royal Navy detachment stationed in Portsmouth. Unfortunately, approximately ten vessels were destroyed in the scuffle; and there's only one solution to this outright attack against Britain and her people."
frafor.77.d:0 "As we sent demands to the French Government to halt these air squadrons, it became apparent that the French Armee de l'Air was carrying out attacks against the Royal Navy detachment stationed in Portsmouth. Unfortunately, approximately ten vessels were destroyed in the scuffle; and there's only one solution to this outright attack against Britain and her people."
frafor.78.d:0 "The Portsmouth attack was a success! The Armee de l'Air has successfully destroyed a large number of English naval vessels!"
frafor.79.d:0 "A state-visit to Washington DC has been organized by the French. American and French delegations have talked about a variety of topics, however the general consensus concerning the results of the state-visit remain to be seen."
frafor.80.d:0 "The NAFTA stands for the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement. It entails free trade between the partner-states within the organization, and as we've joined the Entente we have also received an invite to it."
frafor.81.d:0 "As we've left the Entente, we've also been forced to resign from the N.A.F.T.A."

#Political stuff

frapol.1.t:0 "PRS endorses the SFIO"
frapol.1.d:0 "Due to France's electoral system, parties like the PRS and SFIO effectively steal each other's votes in each district, this leads to neither of them getting many votes in any district. To combat this problem the two left parties, the social-democratic PRS and the libertarian socialist SFIO, have decided that it would be best if the PRS, the currently smaller leftist party, to endorse the SFIO to ensure a left wing victory in the coming election."
frapol.1.a:0 "Leftists unifying? They'll split in a few months time."
frapol.2.t:0 "1936년 프랑스 총선"
frapol.2.d:0 "After a long period of unrest and protests, the French elections have finally concluded. The elections were full of surprises and newcomers, the radical left represented by the SFIO and the radical right represented by the AF see increased popularity mainly due to the ecopnomic and social issues in France. There are currently two options on the table how to continue, either a left coalition consisting of SFIO, PRS and PR, or a centre-right coalition consisting of FR, ADR and PR. Which of these possible coalitions should be formed in the coming months?"
frapol.2.a:0 "PR, PRS and SFIO will try to form a coalition!"
frapol.2.b:0 "FR, ADR and PR will try to form a coalition!"
frapol.3.t:0 "The Issue of Diplomacy"
frapol.3.d:0 "The first topic of the coalition talks will be diplomacy. The SFIO is strongly against allying with any bourgeois powers and also against any offensive intervention in countries like Germany. The PRS is in a middle-ground, willing to seek alliances with other bourgeois powers but reluctant to take action against Germany if it were to result in another Great War. The PR is a lot more pragmatic, they want to seek allies where necessary and see military intervention as a justifiable last resort. Can a compromise be made?"
frapol.3.a:0 "A case to case basis will be the best option"
frapol.3.b:0 "The SFIO will not listen to this bourgeois rhetoric!"
frapol.4.t:0 "The question of Unions"
frapol.4.d:0 "Unionisation, one of the key issues that have appeared after the election. The people seem to strike more and more and there needs to be a way to solve this. The SFIO & PRS proposes to give the unions whatever they desire, the PR on the other hand, proposes to directly talk to the people themselves and give them what they want. What is the best way to solve this dilemma?"
frapol.4.a:0 "Listen, but succumb to the unions"
frapol.4.b:0 "The SFIO demands unionisation!"
frapol.5.t:0 "The Workweek"
frapol.5.d:0 "Currently France has a fourty hour work week, which equates to eight hours a day, five days a week. The SFIO demand a reduction to thirty hours, seeing as the bourgeois pigs work even less than that, the PR however, thinks this massive reduction suddenly might harm the economy and propose a simple increase in minimum wage to compensate."
frapol.5.a:0 "How about thirty-six hours?"
frapol.5.b:0 "Thirty hours is a must"
frapol.6.t:0 "The question of religion"
frapol.6.d:0 "The 1905 French law on the separation of Church and State removed the privileged status of the state religion. However due to the current issues around the world, people are coming back to christianity for its stability and unity. The FR proposes to endorse this christian movement to both help the population and also hopefully steal some voters from the christian AF, the other two parties however, value religious freedom and propose to keep this freedom."
frapol.6.a:0 "Maybe just endorse some christian values?"
frapol.6.b:0 "The will of god is more important than two puny parties!"
frapol.7.t:0 "The question of Unions"
frapol.7.d:0 "Unionisation, one of the key issues that have appeared after the election. The people seem to strike more and more and there needs to be a way to solve this. The FR and ADR propose to simply outlaw strikes to solve this problem, the PR thinks this is highly limiting the freedom of the individual and thus proposes to simply ignore the strikers."
frapol.7.a:0 "Just tax the unions as a compromise"
frapol.7.b:0 "Striking is crime and must be outlawed, whatever the PR says!"
frapol.8.t:0 "The minimum wage"
frapol.8.d:0 "France does not have a nationwide minimum wage at the moment, the PR has put forward a proposal to introduce a nationwide minimum wage to abolish the large difference between French provinces in minimum wage. The other two parties desire to have no minimum of any kind."
frapol.8.a:0 "No minimum wage for now"
frapol.8.b:0 "The minimum wage is a must for the PR!"
frapol.9.t:0 "PR-PRS-SFIO coalition talks fail!"
frapol.9.d:0 "After months of debating the leaders of the PR, PRS and SFIO have decided that it would be in their and the nation's best interest to stop these coalition talks. The leader said that the gap between the two parties was simply one too big to cross. Now the FR, ADR and PR will try to form a coalition."
frapol.9.a:0 "Best of luck to them!"
frapol.10.t:0 "PR-PRS-SFIO 연정 협상이 체결되다!"
frapol.10.d:0 "The coalition talks between the PR, PRS and the SFIO have had a positive outcome, the parties have agreed to a coalition agreement and are expected to be inaugurated in their positions soon. France has another government again!"
frapol.10.a:0 "Hurrah!"
frapol.11.t:0 "FR-ADR-PR 연정 협상이 결렬되다!"
frapol.11.d:0 "AFter several months of intense debate the centre right coalition talks have failed. There were several issues which the parties proclaimed were simply impossible to get an agreement about. France has to go on without a government for a few months more sadly. The SFIO and PR will now try to form a new coalition."
frapol.11.a:0 "Hopefully the leftists are more competent"
frapol.12.t:0 "FR-ADR-PR coalition talks successful"
frapol.12.d:0 "The coalition talks that have been going on in the last few months between the FR, ADR and PR have succeded. This means that France finally has a government again and that the nation will head into the future with a centre-right coalition."
frapol.12.a:0 "Yay"
frapol.13.t:0 "Another coalition talk fails"
frapol.13.d:0 "Coalition talks have failed again. After another few months, the parties could still not agree to any sort of agreement. The people are becoming restless due to the long time the nation has been without a proper government. New elections will be held in a few months time where there will hopefully be a more conclusive result."
frapol.13.a:0 "Long live democracy..."
frapol.14.t:0 "The end of the LSMC"
frapol.14.d:0 "The LSMC has finally ended. After some drastic reforms the economy is growing again and people are getting jobs again. France is finally back on her feet!"
frapol.14.a:0 "It's over"
frapol.15.t:0 "New Elections are called"
frapol.15.d:0 "Due to the faliure of the previous government to form a coalition, new elections have been called."
frapol.15.a:0 "SFIO가 승리하다!"
frapol.15.b:0 "A Grand Coalition against the Extrémistes is formed!"
frapol.15.c:0 "악시옹 프랑세예즈가 승리하다!"
